# Sideways Shooter 2D  

A 2D side-scrolling shooter game framework that includes basic movement and shooting mechanics as a starting point for further development.

## Overview  

Sideways Shooter 2D is a preliminary framework for a 2D side-scrolling shooter game. The project currently includes basic player movement and shooting functionality, which can be used as the foundation for further development of a complete shooter game. It is designed to be expanded upon with additional features such as enemies, power-ups, scoring, and more.

## Features  

- Basic player-controlled spaceship movement (up, down, left, right).  
- Shooting functionality to fire bullets from the player's spaceship.  
- Framework ready to be extended with game mechanics such as enemy behavior, levels, and power-ups.
